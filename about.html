                                <p>The whole process was super easy and quick, the staff responded to each email right away and helped us through each step. We rented the lamborghini aventador...the coolest car I have ever seen and driven in. 
                                    The best price out of any other company also. The car arrived right on time right in front of our hotel and only took about 10 minutes before we were off in a yellow Lambo. We drove from Luxembourg to Berlin, 
                                    to south beach and went way over the miles but it was for sure worth it. 
                                    Can't wait for next time we come for our next rental!
                                </p>

                                <p>I have rented exotic cars in the past in Europe however; my experience with Luxury&Cars blew everyone else out of the water! The customer service from the first call up to delivery of the car was extraordinary. 
                                    The car arrived clean and was ready to be enjoyed. I rented a Bugatti. Was a lot fun! The entire staff was prompt, kind, and very accommodating. I will absolutely use Luxury&Cars EVERY time I am in Europe, FL. 
                                    Thank you to Terry, Jr. and Rosa for making my exotic car rental experience excellent!

                                <p>After trying a few other exotic car rental companies and being unsatisfied with their customer interactions I was referred to Luxury&Cars. 
                                    The attention and high level of service was evident during the entire process. Within hours we were at the facility picking up an Aston Martin Vanquish. 
                                    The showroom was absolutely impressive. Terry, our sales contact, was very knowledgeable about the specifics of this car. She is an excellent ambassador for Luxury&Cars. 
                                    Overall outstanding experience and definitely would recommend.
